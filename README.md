# ASYM0B
ASYM0B (**A** framework for **SY**ste**M**atically assessment **O**f chat**B**ots) is a framework to analyse and assess conversational agents or chatbots built in different tools. To support chatbots from different platforms, ASYM0B relies on a neutral chatbot definition called CONGA. 

This repository contains two different asymob environemnts. All the chatbots used in these environments can be accesed in [link](https://github.com/ASYM0B/evaluation)

The list below shows the content of each folder: 
- **asymobTestSimple:** introduces the asymob framework with a simple example, where the basic metrics are used. 
- **asymobTestExtended:** provides a more extended use case of asymob, by using more complex metrics.
